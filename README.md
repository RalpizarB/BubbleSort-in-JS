# BubbleSort-in-JS
A simple Bubblesort Animation in JS
This code is a visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm in action. The algorithm is used to sort an array of numbers by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order.

The visualization is displayed in a canvas element with a height and width of 400 pixels. The canvas is bordered and has padding, and the buttons to control the visualization are displayed in a container below the canvas.

The "Next" button allows you to step through the sorting process one step at a time. The "Play" button automatically runs the sorting algorithm at a set interval, and the "Stop" button stops the automatic sorting.

The code uses event listeners to detect when the buttons are clicked and calls the appropriate functions to perform the desired action. The main functions of the code are fill, sortbubble, drawsort, and drawCanvasBG, which handle the initialization of the array, the sorting algorithm, and the visualization of the array in the canvas.

To use this code, simply open the HTML file in a web browser and interact with the buttons to observe the sorting process. The code can be easily modified to sort a different array of numbers by changing the values in the sortme array.
